My PhD is part of the  CRUK [Accelerator](https://mach3cancer.org/) award. I have an undergraduate degree in Statistics from the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) and a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

My current work focusses on developing computer vision techniques to undertand live 3D cancer biology. My research interests are in Deep Learning, 3D Computer Vision, Shape Analysis and Explainable AI.
