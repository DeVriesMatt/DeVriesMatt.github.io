title: "What do machines see? Utilizing artificial intelligence to explore cell biology"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-what-do-machines-see.md
excerpt: 'With our ability to take and quantify numerous complex images of cells and cell populations, the ability to paint an accurate picture of the underlying data has never been more valuable. Deferring from the contemporary classics in data visualization to methods that exploit advances in artificial intelligence is an essential step in understanding high-throughput, three-dimensional microscopy data. This feature article discusses how generating or simulating representative cells that may not exist in the data set, yet summarize the underlying distribution, allows researchers to effectively and efficiently analyse cellular morpho-dynamics. Furthermore, learning from these artificial intelligence-based techniques allows us to ‘see what the machine is seeing’ in a step towards unpacking the chaos of cell biology to understand the very fundamentals of living organisms.'
